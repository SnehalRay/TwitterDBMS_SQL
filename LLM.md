prompt:
get my the current date with python

response:
To get the current date in Python, you can use the `datetime` module from the Python standard library. Here's an example:

```python
from datetime import datetime

current_date = datetime.now().date()
print(current_date)
```

This code snippet retrieves the current date using the `datetime.now()` function, which returns a `datetime` object representing the current date and time. The `.date()` method extracts only the date portion.

When you run this code, it will output the current date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

For example:

```python
2023-10-29
```

This will represent the current date at the time the code is executed.

prompt: 
for sqlite python how to check if in an input is in sql text

response:
If you want to check if a specific input string is present in a SQLite text column in Python, you can use a SQL query with the `LIKE` operator or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Here's how you can do it:

1. Using `LIKE` operator:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Input string to search for
search_input = "search_text"

# SQL query using the LIKE operator
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_column LIKE ?"
cursor.execute(sql_query, ('%' + search_input + '%',))

# Fetch the results
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Check if any results were found
if results:
    print("Input text exists in the database.")
else:
    print("Input text not found in the database.")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

2. Using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Input string to search for
search_input = "search_text"

# Use a prepared statement
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_column LIKE ?"
cursor.execute(sql_query, ('%' + search_input + '%',))

# Fetch the results
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Check if any results were found
if results:
    print("Input text exists in the database.")
else:
    print("Input text not found in the database.")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

In both examples, we use the `LIKE` operator to search for the input text within the specified column. We wrap the input string in `%` characters to perform a partial match. This will return rows where the input text is found anywhere within the column. If any results are found, it indicates that the input text is present in the SQLite text column.

prompt: 
with python find a new random int not in a list


response:
Certainly! You can use Python's `random` module to generate a new random integer that is not present in a given list. Here's an example:

```python
import random

def new_random(_list, lower_bound, upper_bound):
    random_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)
    
    while random_number in _list:
        random_number = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)
    
    return random_number

# Example usage:
my_list = [2, 5, 7, 10]  # Your list
lower_limit = 1  # Lower limit for the random number
upper_limit = 10  # Upper limit for the random number

new_random_number = new_random(my_list, lower_limit, upper_limit)
print("New random number not in the list:", new_random_number)
```

This script defines a function `new_random` that takes the list to exclude numbers from, as well as the lower and upper bounds for the range of the random numbers. The function repeatedly generates a random number until it finds one that is not in the given list, then returns that number.
